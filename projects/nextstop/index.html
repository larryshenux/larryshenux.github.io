                <h2 class="mb-4">Overview</h2>
                <p>Ever been late for the school bus before? Or worse yet, experience that sinking feeling as your bus turns a corner and drives off right as you come into sight of your bus stop? You knew you were running late, but that didn't stop you from trying. Wouldn't it be nice to have a way of knowing where the bus is at all times?</p>
                <p>For parents, it's not always easy to find the information you need on transportation, bus stops, bus times, etc. If you're lucky, there might be a convenient link somewhere on your child's school website. But more often than not, you will likely have to dig through the pages or resort to a search to find what you need. Wouldn't it be helpful to have all that information in one place, organized in a structured, easy to use medium?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Enter NextStop, a mobile app designed to be your one-stop-shop for all things related to bus information.</p>
                <br>
                <p>NextStop provides a streamlined experience for parents and students to get the bus information they need at their fingertips. It will feature an intuitive interface and added features like bus location tracking and estimated arrival times.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4">Design Process</h2>
                <p>The first thing I needed to do was to fully understand the problems I had to address. While I knew generally what should be in the bus app, I didn't know the specific pain points and challenges faced by users. With this in mind, I thought of some interview questions I wanted to ask my target audience to better understand their needs.</p>
                <h3>Questions I asked</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where do you currently get bus route information?</li>
                    <li>Are you satisfied with the way you get this information and of the information itself?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If not, what are some things that you find lacking/frustrating about the process?</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>What are some things that would make it easier for you to find this information?</li>
                    <li>What features would you find most useful in a bus information app?</li>
                    <li>Are there any additional things that could be added to the bus route information that could prove useful for you?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I interviewed 2 parents and 1 student for this part. During the interview, I realized that being able to ask great follow-up questions is a crucial skill for uncovering deeper insights. Even though I had prepared questions in advance, I never really knew what responses I would get from my interviewees. Being adaptable and quick to jump on key points during these interviews would help me get a clearer picture of the problem and allow me to create more accurate personas.</p>
