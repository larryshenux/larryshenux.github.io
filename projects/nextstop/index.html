                <p>Ever been late for the school bus before? Or worse yet, experience that sinking feeling as your bus turns a corner and drives off right as you come into sight of your bus stop? You knew you were running late, but that didn't stop you from trying. Wouldn't it be nice to have a way of knowing where the bus is at all times?</p>
                <p>For parents, it's not always easy to find the information you need on transportation, bus stops, bus times, etc. If you're lucky, there might be a convenient link somewhere on your child's school website. But more often than not, you will likely have to dig through the pages or resort to a search to find what you need. Wouldn't it be helpful to have all that information in one place, organized in a structured, easy to use medium?</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4">Empathize</h2>
                <p>The first thing I needed to do was to fully understand the problems I had to address. While I knew generally what should be in the bus app, I didn't know the specific pain points and challenges faced by users. With this in mind, I thought of some interview questions I wanted to ask my target audience to better understand their needs.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where do you currently get bus route information?</li>
                    <li>Are you satisfied with the way you get this information and of the information itself?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If not, what are some things that you find lacking/frustrating about the process?</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>What are some things that would make it easier for you to find this information?</li>
                    <li>What features would you find most useful in a bus information app?</li>
                    <li>Are there any additional things that could be added to the bus route information that could prove useful for you?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I interviewed 2 parents and 1 student for this part. During the interview, I realized that being able to ask great follow-up questions is a crucial skill for uncovering deeper insights. Even though I had prepared questions in advance, I never really knew what responses I would get from my interviewees. Being adaptable and quick to jump on key points would help me get a clearer picture of the problem and allow me to create more accurate personas.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">User Journeys</h3>
            <p>Once I had defined user personas, I created two user journey maps for the current flow they take to find bus route information or to receive bus updates, helping me understand their pain points and behaviors from their perspective.</p>

            <!-- User Journey Maps -->
            <div class="my-5">
                <img src="nextstop-assets/user-journey-map-1.png" alt="User Journey Map 1" class="img-fluid w-100 rounded shadow-sm">
                <div class="text-center text-secondary mt-2 small image-caption">User Journey Map 1: Parent's Experience</div>
            </div>
            <div class="my-5">
                <img src="nextstop-assets/user-journey-map-2.png" alt="User Journey Map 2" class="img-fluid w-100 rounded shadow-sm">
                <div class="text-center text-secondary mt-2 small image-caption">User Journey Map 2: Student's Experience</div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container my-5">
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-8">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Define</h2>
                <p>With the journey maps created, I was ready to define the main problems that my app would solve. During the prior interviews, I had written a one sentence user story for each person highlighting their needs. Taking these into account as well as the information I gathered from the journey maps, I formulated them into problem statements which explicitly lays out their problem to solve.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">User Stories and Problem Statements</h3>
                <p>It was interesting for me to see the similarities and differences between the user stories and problem statements. While the user story focuses on the user's needs and goals from their perspective, the problem statement frames the issue in a way that highlights the user's challenges in a specific context from an objective, third-person perspective, giving it a concreteness that makes it more tangible to address.</p>
                <h4>Tammy</h4>
                <table class="content-table indented-table">
                <tr>
                    <td>User Story</td>
                    <td>As a busy mother of two, I would like an easy way to access all relevant and up-to-date bus related information in one place so that I don't have to spend time searching for them.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Problem Statement</td>
                    <td>Tammy is a busy mother who needs a quick and convenient way of accessing bus information because it will save her from having to spend extra mental bandwidth scouring for that information.</td>
                </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Billy</h4>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Problem Statement</td>
                    <td>Billy is a student who needs real-time updates on bus status so he can plan his arrival at the bus stop and avoid unnecessary waiting or missed buses.</td>
                </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Janet</h4>
                <table class="content-table indented-table">
                <tr>
                    <td>User Story</td>
                    <td>As a mother who isn't great with technology, it would help me if the bus route map/app is easy to use so that I can quickly get the information I need.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Problem Statement</td>
                    <td>Janet needs a user-friendly bus information app because a complicated interface makes it difficult for her to find the information she needs in a timely manner.</td>
                </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Hypothesis Statements</h4>
                <p>Based on the user stories and problem statements, I came up with the following hypotheses:</p>
                <ol class="text-secondary fst-italic">
                    <li>If Tammy can get bus information from an app designed specifically for that purpose, all the information she needs will be contained in one place, ensuring her convenience.</li>
                    <li>If Billy can conveniently see bus status updates within an app on his phone, he will not feel as rushed or worried in the morning as he prepares to leave for school.</li>
                    <li>If Janet can use an app with minimal elements and a familiar layout, it would greatly improve her experience of finding the bus information she needs.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Through these hypothesis statements, I determined the focus for my app, summarized into one value proposition:</p>
                <p class="bd-callout mt-4 mb-5" data-border-color="#ffc107" data-base-color="#fef095"><strong>NextStop</strong> provides a <i>streamlined experience</i> for parents and students to get the bus information they need at their fingertips. It sports an intuitive interface and added features like <i>bus location tracking</i> and <i>estimated arrival times</i> so that no one will be in the dark about their bus's whereabouts.</p>

            <div class="col-8">
                <h2>Ideate</h2>
                <p>Now that I had a clear idea of the problems I'm solving for, I needed to list out the core app requirements that would address them. Having a list of must have features ready as I start sketching out potential designs will help ensure that I don't forget any important features.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">App Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Map of routes with live bus tracking</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stop location</li>
                        <li>Arrival times, ETA</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Updates/notification messages</li>
                    <li>Stops</li>
                    <li>Route eligibility based on address</li>
                    <li>Information</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact info</li>
                        <li>FAQs</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>Once I had a better idea of what the app needed, I was ready to start planning the layout of the app. To do this, I created an information architecture diagram to map out the structure and high-level flow of the app.</p>

                <p>Initially, I used the hamburger menu in my wireframes, thinking it would be a good way to save space on smaller screens. However, I later realized that this approach might not be the best for discoverability, as users don't immediately see all available options.</p>
                <p>To address this, I explored using a tabbed navigation pattern as well. I felt that the number of functions my app offered did not warrant the use of a hamburger menu. With a bottom menu, users could easily switch between different sections of the app without having to open and close a menu.</p>

                <p>During the wireframing process, I found the "Search Routes" screen to be redundant. The problem was that users already have the option to add routes from the "My Routes" screen, not to mention that they are also inputting their address at the start during the set up of the app. It's unlikely users would want to search for a district they're not zoned for, but in the event they needed to switch districts or addresses, it would make more sense for them to do so in a "Settings" page. Once updated, they will have the option to add routes for their new location on the "My Routes" screen.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">Usability Study</h3>
                <p>With the wireframes ready to go, I was ready to test them out with users. I created a simple lo-fi prototype using the completed wireframes and conducted a usability study with 4 participants. I wanted to identify any usability issues and gather feedback on the functionality of the app.</p>
