                <p>Ever been late for the school bus before? Or worse yet, experience that sinking feeling as your bus turns a corner and drives off right as you come into sight of your bus stop? You knew you were running late, but that didn't stop you from trying. Wouldn't it be nice to have a way of knowing where the bus is at all times?</p>
                <p>For parents, it's not always easy to find the information you need on transportation, bus stops, bus times, etc. If you're lucky, there might be a convenient link somewhere on your child's school website. But more often than not, you will likely have to dig through the pages or resort to a search to find what you need. Wouldn't it be helpful to have all that information in one place, organized in a structured, easy to use medium?</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4">Empathize</h2>
                <p>The first thing I needed to do was to fully understand the problems I had to address. While I knew generally what should be in the bus app, I didn't know the specific pain points and challenges faced by users. With this in mind, I thought of some interview questions I wanted to ask my target audience to better understand their needs.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where do you currently get bus route information?</li>
                    <li>Are you satisfied with the way you get this information and of the information itself?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If not, what are some things that you find lacking/frustrating about the process?</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>What are some things that would make it easier for you to find this information?</li>
                    <li>What features would you find most useful in a bus information app?</li>
                    <li>Are there any additional things that could be added to the bus route information that could prove useful for you?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I interviewed 2 parents and 1 student for this part. During the interview, I realized that being able to ask great follow-up questions is a crucial skill for uncovering deeper insights. Even though I had prepared questions in advance, I never really knew what responses I would get from my interviewees. Being adaptable and quick to jump on key points would help me get a clearer picture of the problem and allow me to create more accurate personas.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">User Journeys</h3>
            <p>Once I had defined user personas, I created two user journey maps for the current flow they take to find bus route information or to receive bus updates, helping me understand their pain points and behaviors from their perspective.</p>

            <!-- User Journey Maps -->
            <div class="my-5">
                <img src="nextstop-assets/user-journey-map-1.png" alt="User Journey Map 1" class="img-fluid w-100 rounded shadow-sm">

            </div>

                <img src="nextstop-assets/user-journey-map-2.png" alt="User Journey Map 2" class="img-fluid w-100 rounded shadow-sm">
                <div class="text-center text-secondary mt-2 small image-caption">User Journey Map 2: Student's Experience</div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container my-5">
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-8">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Define</h2>
                <p>Having created the journey maps and personas, it was time to define the main problems the app would solve. During the prior interviews, I had written a one sentence user story for each person highlighting their needs. Taking these into account as well as the information I gathered from the journey maps, I formulated them into problem statements which explicitly lays out their problem to solve.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">User Stories and Problem Statements</h3>
                <p>It was interesting for me to see the similarities and differences between the user stories and problem statements. While the user story focuses on the user's needs and goals from their perspective, the problem statement frames the issue in a way that highlights the user's challenges in a specific context from an objective, third-person perspective, giving it a concreteness that makes it more tangible to address.</p>
                <h4>Tammy</h4>
                <table class="content-table indent">
                <tr>
                    <td>User Story</td>
                    <td>As a busy mother of two, I would like an easy way to access all relevant and up-to-date bus related information in one place so that I don't have to spend time searching for them.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Problem Statement</td>
                    <td>Tammy is a busy mother who needs a quick and convenient way of accessing bus information because it will save her from having to spend extra mental bandwidth scouring for that information.</td>
                </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Billy</h4>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Problem Statement</td>
                    <td>Billy is a student who needs real-time updates on bus status so he can plan his arrival at the bus stop and avoid unnecessary waiting or missed buses.</td>
                </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Janet</h4>
                <table class="content-table indent">
                <tr>
                    <td>User Story</td>
                    <td>As a mother who isn't great with technology, it would help me if the bus route map/app is easy to use so that I can quickly get the information I need.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Problem Statement</td>
                    <td>Janet needs a user-friendly bus information app because a complicated interface makes it difficult for her to find the information she needs in a timely manner.</td>
                </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Hypothesis Statements</h4>
                <p>Based on the user stories and problem statements, I came up with the following hypotheses:</p>
                <ol class="text-secondary fst-italic">
                    <li>If Tammy can get bus information from an app designed specifically for that purpose, all the information she needs will be contained in one place, ensuring her convenience.</li>
                    <li>If Billy can conveniently see bus status updates within an app on his phone, he will not feel as rushed or worried in the morning as he prepares to leave for school.</li>
                    <li>If Janet can use an app with minimal elements and a familiar layout, it would greatly improve her experience of finding the bus information she needs.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Through these hypothesis statements, I determined the focus for my app, summarized into one value proposition:</p>
                <p class="bd-callout mt-4 mb-5" data-border-color="#ffc107" data-base-color="#fef095"><strong>NextStop</strong> provides a <i>streamlined experience</i> for parents and students to get the bus information they need at their fingertips. It sports an intuitive interface and added features like <i>bus location tracking</i> and <i>estimated arrival times</i> so that no one will be in the dark about their bus's whereabouts.</p>

    <!-- Ideate Process -->

            <div class="col-8">
                <h2>Ideate</h2>
                <p>Now that I had a clear idea of the problems I'm solving for, I needed to list out the core app requirements that would address them. Having a list of must have features ready as I start sketching out potential designs will help ensure that I don't forget any important features.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">App Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Map of routes with live bus tracking</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stop location</li>
                        <li>Arrival times, ETA</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Updates/notification messages</li>
                    <li>Stops</li>
                    <li>Route eligibility based on address</li>
                    <li>Information</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact info</li>
                        <li>FAQs</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>Once I had a better idea of what the app needed, I started planning the layout of the app. To do this, I created an information architecture diagram to map out the structure and high-level flow of the app.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">IA Diagram</h3>
                <img src="nextstop-assets/nextstop-ia-diagram.jpg" alt="NextStop Information Architecture Diagram" class="img-fluid my-4 shadow-sm">
                <p>Using the IA diagram as a guide, I sketched out wireframes for the main screens of the app.</p>
                <p>Starting off with the welcome screen where users are greeted with a friendly message and prompted to enter their school district and address, the next screen that displays would be the <i>My Routes</i> screen. Here, users can add bus routes for their address and view route information such as arrival times and stop location. When users attempt to add a route, it will direct them to the <i>Route Search</i> screen where they can make their selection. Once a route is selected, they will be taken back to the <i>My Routes</i> screen.</p>
                <p>The notifications screen will display important updates and alerts for users, such as bus delays, weather updates, or school closures. Users will see an alert bubble pop up on the bottom menu icon to indicate new notifications.</p>
                <p>The information screen will provide users with contact information for schools in the chosen district and transportation department. FAQs can also be found on this screen.</p>
                <p>Finally, the app will include a screen where users can submit any concerns or feedback to the district.</p>

                <p>In my initial designs, I used the hamburger menu in my wireframes, thinking it would be a good way to save space on smaller screens. However, I later realized that this approach might not be the best for discoverability, as users don't immediately see all available options.</p>
                <p>To address this, I explored using a tabbed navigation pattern as well. I felt that the number of functions my app offered did not warrant the use of a hamburger menu. With a bottom menu, users could easily switch between different sections of the app without having to open and close a menu.</p>
                <img src="nextstop-assets/bottom-nav-wf.png" alt="Bottom Navigation Wireframe" class="img-fluid my-5 shadow-sm d-block mx-auto">
                <p>Also during the wireframing process, I found the "Search Routes" screen to be redundant. The problem was if users are adding routes from the "My Routes" screen, why should they be taken away to a different screen just to perform that task? Why not contain that functionality within the "My Routes" screen?</p>
                <p>They are already inputting their address at the start during the app setup. It's unlikely users would want to search for a district they're not zoned for, but in the event they needed to switch districts or addresses, it would make more sense for them to do so in a "Settings" page. Once updated, they will have the option to add routes for their new location on the "My Routes" screen.</p>
                <p>Another thing I realized was that maybe having a "Submit a Concern" screen may not be necessary. If a parent or student had an issue they wanted to bring up, they can reference the contact info from the information screen and submit their concern through the appropriate channels, so the additional screen dedicated for that purpose seemed to be extraneous.</p>
                <p>With these considerations in mind, I aimed to streamline the user experience and reduce unnecessary screens.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">Usability Study</h3>
                <p>With the wireframes completed, I was ready to test them out with users. I built a simple lo-fi prototype referencing the completed wireframes and conducted a usability study with 4 participants to identify any usability issues and gather feedback on the functionality of the app.</p>
                <div class="horizontal-scrollbar mt-4" style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%;">
                    <img src="nextstop-assets/nextstop-lofi-wireframes.png" alt="NextStop Lo-Fi Wireframes" style="width: 1200px; max-width: none; height: auto; display: block;" class="shadow-sm rounded">
                </div>
                <div class="text-center text-secondary mt-2 mb-5 small image-caption">Low fidelity wireframes used in first prototype</div>
                <p>My study plan aimed to answer these key research questions:</p>
                <ul class="mb-5">
                    <li>Is the app intuitive to use?</li>
                    <li>How easy is it for users to find and add a route to track?</li>
                    <li>How long does it take users to complete their desired tasks?</li>
                    <li>Does the app provide a better experience for users than their existing way of finding bus information?</li>
                    <li>Are there additional opportunities for design changes to further enhance user experience?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To measure the effectiveness of the app designs, I had each participant complete a series of tasks which would then be evaluated against two main KPIs: time on task and conversion rates. As they performed each task, they were encouraged to think aloud and share their thought process. The time of completion of each task was then recorded and the difficulty of the task was rated on a scale from 1 to 3 as follows: </p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled indent mb-5">
                    <li>1 - Easy to complete</li>
                    <li>2 - Completed but with some difficulty</li>
                    <li>3 - Not completed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I had each participant complete 4 tasks, each corresponding to a defining feature within the app:</p>
                <ol class="list-gap mb-5">
                    <li>App setup and adding a new route to track</li>
                    <li>Changing your address</li>
                    <li>Checking for notifications</li>
                    <li>Finding contact information</li>
                </ol>
                <p>During each task, I took note of my observations and asked follow-up questions like "Was this feature useful? Why or why not?" and "What was easy and what was challenging?"</p>
                <p>At the end of the study, I gathered feedback and overall impressions from each participant. I also asked the following research wrap up questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At any point during any of the tasks, were you confused or uncertain on how to perform a certain action?</li>
                    <li>Did you experience anything unexpected as you were navigating through the app?</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="mt-5">Affinity Diagram</h4>
                <p>After the study, I analyzed the data I collected and organized similar findings and comments from participants into groups of sticky notes. I wanted to identify patterns from the research to see where users tended to struggle or excel within the app.</p>
                <div class="horizontal-scrollbar my-5" style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%;">
                    <img src="nextstop-assets/nextstop-affinity-diagram.png" alt="NextStop Lo-Fi Wireframes" style="width: 1200px; max-width: none; height: auto; display: block;" class="shadow-sm rounded">
                </div>
                <p>From this exercise, I identified several insights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most users ended up opening the settings screen as they were trying to add a route to their list. This meant the current pop-up for adding routes isn't intuitive enough for users to successfully add a route.</li>
                    <li>Some users tapped the route bar in the pop-up to add a route. It seems like the addition button isn't an effective indicator for users to add a route.</li>
                    <li>Some users didn't use the chips to remove filters. Not all users recognized the function of the chips and opted to use the more familiar filter icon instead.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some of the groupings in the affinity diagram, like the one on "unresponsive welcome page elements", had more to do with missing features in the low-fidelity prototype rather than actual usability issues related to the design of the app. As such, those groupings were given less weight when coming up with design enhancements.</p>
                <h4 class="mt-5">Recommendations</h4>
                <p>Based on the insights gathered from the study, I made the following design recommendations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow the user to add a route not only by tapping the addition button but also by tapping on the route bar option itself to lower the chances of failing to add a route.</li>
                    <li>Provide flexibility for filtering capabilities, whether by using the chips or the filter icon, to accommodate different user preferences.</li>
                    <li>Make it easier for users to understand what to do once they set up the app.</li>
                </ul>

    <!-- Hi-fi Prototype -->
    <div class="container my-5">
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-8">
                <h2>Hi-fi Prototype</h2>
                <p>Having tested the prototype and gathered key insights, I proceeded to building a high-fidelity prototype of the NextStop app.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">Style Guide</h3>
                <p>Before I started designing anything though, I needed to first determine the colors and various fonts for the app. To ensure that my app remained consistent throughout, I created a style guide that outlined the color palette and typography to be used.</p>
                <img src="nextstop-assets/nextstop-style-guide.png" alt="NextStop Style Guide" class="img-fluid my-5 shadow-sm d-block mx-auto">
                <p>Other than the color of school buses being the source of inspiration, I chose yellow and purple as the primary colors for the app as they conveyed youthfulness and energy which I thought was befitting of the school setting.</p>
                <p>Aesthetics aside, I also needed to ensure the readability of the text. It had to be clearly visible, following WCAG 2.1 standards for 4.5:1 contrast ratio.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">Hi-fi Mockups</h3>
                <p>As I designed the mockups in Figma, I created reusable components to maintain consistency across the app. I also leveraged existing design libraries like Google's Material Design components to help speed up the process.</p>
